Fourteen industry partners participated in the workshop along with a few researchers from IITGN. In the workshop, Prof. Chinmay Ghoroi, the Principal Investigator of CRTDH, talked about CRTDH and presented the current development and facilities in the CRTDH, including the ICP-MS facility. The workshop was mainly on the basic principle of the ICP-MS and ICP-OES, including its calibration and standardization of the instrument. The universal challenges with Inorganic technique, including the sample preparation and removal of various interference. After providing the basic theoretical background on the various techniques, participants visited the labs for a demonstration of sample preparation using the microwave digester followed by the ICP-MS and ICP-OES demonstration at the CRTDH Lab.",
