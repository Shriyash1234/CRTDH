         "Information-para-1": "Gujarat is home to several chemical-based Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The establishment of the Common Research and Technology Development Hub sponsored by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) and Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, IITGN (DSIR-CRTDH, IITGN) on New Materials/Chemical Processes is one of the important initiatives for chemical industries.",
         "Information-para-2": "Several dyes, dye intermediates, textiles, pharmaceuticals, pigments, food, chemicals etc. are located in Gujarat. Nearly 80% of India's total dye production capacity is in Gujarat due to the availability of raw materials and the dominance of the textile industry in the region. Approximately 70% of the dye products from Gujarat are being exported to different countries. Gujarat has about 1,000 dyestuff units in Ahmedabad, Vatva, Naroda, Odhav, Vadodara, Ankleshwar, Surat, Valsad and Vapi. However, the sector is performing very poorly in terms of waste generation and its treatment. The environmental issue is also preventing manufacturers from producing new products as per market demand and expansion of existing products. The dye effluent contains very high COD and TDS. Released untreated wastewater threatens the environment and causes severe problems to groundwater and surface water. In addition, it is also a water-intensive industry (requires approximately 800 liters of water per kg of dye). Moreover, MSMEs are using age-old manufacturing processes. As water is one of the major problems in the changed climatic condition, a reduction in process water will benefit the industry and society. To achieve aggressive industry growth, we are working on this major problem. Also, any improvement in manufacturing processes, reduction in water usage and waste generation will significantly contribute to our environment.",
         "Information-para-3": "The DSIR-CRTDH, IITGN is working towards developing and customizing different processes and products. A Process Technology Lab and the pilot plant facility are developed under the DSIR - CRTDH Scheme. A multidisciplinary approach is taken to enhance the capabilities of MSMEs. The CRTDH is developing technological know-how for effluent treatment, waste reduction, process improvement, and testing products/raw materials.",
         "Information-para-4":"The help from CRTDH will strengthen MSMEs in the competitive market and expand their business. The DSIR-CRTDH, IITGN is expected to leverage the existence of different centers, high-quality labs, and Research Park at IITGN. The facility is a one-stop solution for many MSME industries and Startups in the Chemical space. "
