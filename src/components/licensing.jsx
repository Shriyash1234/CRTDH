The aluminium hydroxide chloride (AHC) produced from the member industry has been tested in Lab and also pilot scale in 200 L and 400 L to check the efficiency of the product for decreasing the TSS in the STP water. We have tested the two products in various effluents from STPs (Bhavnagar, IITGN, Ahmedabad and Nadiad). Upon successful runs in the pilot scale plant, we tried in Nadiad 0.38 MLD batch and the product is found to reduce the TSS, TOC, COD and increase the DO of STP water.',

Increasing the energy density of traditional lithium- ion batteries (LIBs) is necessary for satisfying the demands of electric vehicles and advanced electronics. Carbon nanotubes (CNT) can significantly improve the performance of anodic materials due to its high electronic conductivity and excellent mechanical properties. However, non-uniform mixing and coating of CNT in composite material limits the application of CNT.',

The experiments will be conducted in triplicates and water displacement methods will be used to measure the gas production. Biological methane potential will be set as accessibility criteria for determining the process stability for 15 days. Gases like oxygen, hydrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, ammonia and hydrogen sulfide will be measured at various intervals. As a part of assessment, parameters like pH, total volatile fatty acids, CHNS analysis, mass, sugars, cellulose, lignin, protein, and fat, both post and pre-digestion, will be analyzed in CRTDH.',
