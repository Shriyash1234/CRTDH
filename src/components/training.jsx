                1. Flexible/ Virtual Model:
                <br />
                The MSMEs may use DSIR-IITGN-CRTDH to develop their innovations for improving their process or effluent treatment or opt for virtual presence through technical support from the researcher at IITGN. The equipment/facilities can be used by themselves after qualification of training or seek necessary help from Scientists of IITGN in consultation with the principal investigator for the DSIR-IITGN-CRTDH project. Intellectual Property remains with the MSMEs. The patent cost will be borne by the company.
                <br />
                <hr />
                2. Licensing Model:
                <br />
                MSMEs in any industrial sector facing issues in dye manufacturing may approach IITGN-CRTDH for developing solutions. IITGN-CRTDH may undertake the development for problems that are common to a sector and carry out prototype / pilot / demonstration plant in collaboration with a MSMEs lead user unit. After proving, the technology will be available on license to other user units or to MSMEs for implementation in user units. The Intellectual Property remains with IITGN.
                <br />
                <hr />
                3. The Joint Venture Model:
                <br />
                Two or more MSMEs can agree to pool their resources for the purpose of development of a new product/process/service. DSIR-IITGN-CRTDH will provide R&D support to MSMEs for developing innovative products and to build confidence, strengthening and competitiveness by extending technical assistance. The IP will be jointly shared by the MSMEs and DSIR-IITGN-CRTDH for joint development of the product/ process.
