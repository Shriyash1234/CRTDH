                The MSMEs may use DSIR-IITGN-CRTDH to develop their innovations for improving their process or effluent treatment or opt for virtual presence through technical support from the researcher at IITGN. The equipment/facilities can be used by themselves after qualification of training or seek necessary help from Scientists of IITGN in consultation with the principal investigator for the DSIR-IITGN-CRTDH project. Intellectual Property remains with the MSMEs. The patent cost will be borne by the company.
